# FE-Fates-Conquest-Birthright
Birthright in the style of Conquest. Basically just adds difficulty to Birthright Lunatic as if it was Conquest. Redesigns levels to achieve this.

##Changes to Individual Chapters:
Chapter 6 Change list:
- Ryoma and Xander are now in the top part of the map much like they are in Conquest, this makes the chapter not impossible anymore.
- Added a fighter and outlaw that are paired up near Leo.
- Gave all of the enemies skills.
- Gave Ryoma Astra for this chapter.
- Paralogue 1: Tragic Start
- More units added to the map
- Re positioning of units
- Some units are paired-up
- This level no longer plays at your own pace, many enemies will start moving at you on different turns. (Boss and top left on turn 15, etc.)
- Basically, run the hell over to Mozu ASAP

Chapter 7 Change list:
- Completely reworked the layout of units and pacing of this chapter.
- 3 rows of units wait in the bottom right part of the map, coming at you in waves from left to right on turn numbers as follows; 3,6, and 9.
- Silas and his squad will begin moving on turn 12.
- Removed the Outlaw that steals the armorslayer until I can find a way to make him appear later in the chapter to match the new pacing.
- Units in this chapter will not just all run into you one at a time, many of them will wait until you are range, and will go for good dual attack chances. (Example: Poison Strike Outlaw attacks first, allowing a fighter to follow up for more damage and supported by the outlaw.

Chapter 8 Change list:
- Mainly focused on the Seal Resistance into Magic +2 and Malefic Aura traps towards the back of the level.
- Movement +1 units to help get around the desert faster.
- Still mostly on Iron weapons.
- A Dual Yumi Archer with Lancebreaker. (Might be too strong)
